# TNSTC-GenAI-AI-Generated-Text-Detection

**Project Overview: Detecting AI-Generated Text Using KerasNLP**

**1. Introduction:**
   - **Objective:** Develop a text classification model using KerasNLP to identify essays generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) compared to those written by humans.
   - **Background:** With the rise of AI-generated content, distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated text has become a crucial task to maintain authenticity and trust in textual data.

**2. Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
   - **Data Sources:** Utilize both the provided dataset and external datasets containing essays labeled as human-authored or AI-generated.
   - **Preprocessing:** Preprocess the text data, including tokenization, padding, and vectorization, using KerasNLP's preprocessing capabilities.

**3. Model Building:**
   - **Architecture:** Build a DebertaV3-based text classification model using KerasNLP's `DebertaV3Classifier`.
   - **Training:** Train the model using a stratified fold-based approach to ensure robustness and generalization.

**4. Training Process:**
   - **Hardware Utilization:** Leverage available hardware resources (GPU/TPU) for efficient model training.
   - **Callbacks:** Implement callbacks for learning rate scheduling, model checkpointing, and Weights & Biases logging for monitoring training progress.

**5. Evaluation and Validation:**
   - **Cross-Validation:** Employ k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance across multiple folds.
   - **Metrics:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), and loss.

**6. Interpretation and Analysis:**
   - **Best Model Selection:** Identify the best-performing model based on validation metrics like AUC and loss.
   - **Results Interpretation:** Analyze model predictions and misclassifications to gain insights into the model's behavior.

**7. Deployment and Reporting:**
   - **Deployment:** Optionally deploy the trained model for inference on new data or real-time applications.
   - **Reporting:** Generate a comprehensive report documenting the project's methodology, results, and key findings.

**8. Tools and Libraries:**
   - **KerasNLP:** Utilize KerasNLP for model building, preprocessing, and tokenization tasks.
   - **Weights & Biases (W&B):** Use W&B for experiment tracking, visualization, and model performance monitoring.

**9. Challenges and Considerations:**
   - **Data Imbalance:** Address potential data class imbalances between human-authored and AI-generated essays.
   - **Model Interpretability:** Explore techniques for interpreting model predictions and understanding its decision-making process.

**10. Future Enhancements:**
   - **Ensemble Methods:** Investigate ensemble techniques to further improve model performance.
   - **Explainability:** Enhance model explainability to provide insights into why certain essays are classified as AI-generated.

**11. Impact and Applications:**
   - **Information Integrity:** Contribute to maintaining information integrity by detecting AI-generated text accurately.
   - **Educational Use:** Provide a tool for educational purposes to differentiate between human and AI-generated content.

**12. Conclusion:**
   - Summarize project outcomes, including model performance, challenges faced, and future directions for enhancing AI-generated text detection.

This project aims to leverage KerasNLP's capabilities to build a robust text classification model for detecting AI-generated text, contributing to the ongoing efforts in maintaining authenticity and trustworthiness in textual data.
